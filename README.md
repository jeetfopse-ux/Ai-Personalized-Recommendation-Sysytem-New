## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Debugging

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'models'` | Running scripts from subdirectory without root in `PYTHONPATH` | Run `pytest` or `python -m pytest`. All test files and `pytest.ini` now automatically include the root path. |
| No Gemini / OpenAI API Key | Missing key in `.env` | The app includes a built-in rule-based financial advisor fallback. No key is required for core functionality, but adding one enables live LLM generation. |
| Port 5000 already in use | Another process running on port 5000 | Set `PORT=5001` in `.env` or run `$env:PORT="5001"; python app.py`. |
| Reset Database | Clear existing demo/test data | Delete `finance_advisor.db` and run `python seed.py`. |
